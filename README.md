# Convolutional-Neural-Network-

This tutorial demonstrates training a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify CIFAR images.

Implemented using:
* Tensorflow
* Keras Sequential API


## Dataset

The CIFAR10 dataset contains 60,000 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images in each class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
